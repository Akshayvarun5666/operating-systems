# System Model

A system consists of a finite number of resources to be distributed among a number of competing threads. The resources may be partitioned into several types (or classes), each consisting of some number of identical instances. CPU cycles, files, and I/O devices (such as network interfaces and DVD drives) are examples of resource types. If a system has four CPUs, then the resource type _CPU_ has four instances. Similarly, the resource type _network_ may have two instances. If a thread requests an instance of a resource type, the allocation of **_any_** instance of the type should satisfy the request. If it does not, then the instances are not identical, and the resource type classes have not been defined properly.

The various synchronization tools discussed in Chapter 6, such as mutex locks and semaphores, are also system resources; and on contemporary com- puter systems, they are the most common sources of deadlock. However, def- inition is not a problem here. A lock is typically associated with a specific data structureâ€”that is, one lock may be used to protect access to a queue, another to protect access to a linked list, and so forth. For that reason, each instance of a lock is typically assigned its own resource class.

Note that throughout this chapter we discuss kernel resources, but threads may use resources from other processes (for example, via interprocess commu- nication), and those resource uses can also result in deadlock. Such deadlocks are not the concern of the kernel and thus not described here.

A thread must request a resource before using it and must release the resource after using it. A thread may request as many resources as it requires to carry out its designated task. Obviously, the number of resources requested may not exceed the total number of resources available in the system. In other words, a thread cannot request two network interfaces if the system has only one.

Under the normal mode of operation, a thread may utilize a resource in only the following sequence:

**1. Request**. The thread requests the resource. If the request cannot be granted immediately (for example, if a mutex lock is currently held by another thread), then the requesting thread must wait until it can acquire the resource.

**2. Use**. The thread can operate on the resource (for example, if the resource is a mutex lock, the thread can access its critical section).

**3. Release**. The thread releases the resource.

The request and release of resources may be system calls, as explained in Chapter 2. Examples are the request() and release() of a device, open() and close() of a file, and allocate() and free() memory system calls. Similarly, as we saw in Chapter 6, request and release can be accomplished through the wait() and signal() operations on semaphores and through acquire() and release() of a mutex lock. For each use of a kernel-managed resource by a thread, the operating system checks to make sure that the thread has requested and has been allocated the resource. A system table records whether each resource is free or allocated. For each resource that is allocated, the table also records the thread to which it is allocated. If a thread requests a resource that is currently allocated to another thread, it can be added to a queue of threads waiting for this resource.

A set of threads is in a deadlocked statewhen every thread in the set iswait- ing for an event that can be caused only by another thread in the set. The events with which we are mainly concerned here are resource acquisition and release. The resources are typically logical (for example, mutex locks, semaphores, and files); however, other types of events may result in deadlocks, including read- ing from a network interface or the IPC (interprocess communication) facilities discussed in Chapter 3.

To illustrate a deadlocked state, we refer back to the dining-philosophers problem from Section 7.1.3. In this situation, resources are represented by chopsticks. If all the philosophers get hungry at the same time, and each philosopher grabs the chopstick on her left, there are no longer any available chopsticks. Each philosopher is then blocked waiting for her right chopstick to become available.

Developers of multithreaded applications must remain aware of the pos- sibility of deadlocks. The locking tools presented in Chapter 6 are designed to avoid race conditions. However, in using these tools, developers must pay careful attention to how locks are acquired and released. Otherwise, deadlock can occur, as described next.
