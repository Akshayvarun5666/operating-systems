**_Security and Protection_**

Security ensures the authentication of system users to protect the integrity of the information stored in the system (both data and code), as well as the physical resources of the computer system. The security system prevents unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration of data, and accidental introduction of inconsistency.

Protection mechanisms control access to a system by limiting the types of file access permitted to users. In addition, protectionmust ensure that only processes that have gained proper authorization from the oper- ating system can operate on memory segments, the CPU, and other resources.

Protection is provided by a mechanism that controls the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system. This mechanism must provide a means for specifying the con- trols to be imposed, together with a means of enforcing them.
