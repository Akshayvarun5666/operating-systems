# Protection

In Chapter 16, we addressed security, which involves guarding computer resources against unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental introduction of inconsistency. In this chapter, we turn to protection, which involves controlling the access of processes and users to the resources defined by a computer system.

The processes in an operating systemmust be protected from one another’s activities. To provide this protection, we can use variousmechanisms to ensure that only processes that have gained proper authorization from the operating system can operate on the files, memory segments, CPU, networking, and other resources of a system. These mechanisms must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed, together with a means of enforcement.

**CHAPTER OBJECTIVES**

• Discuss the goals and principles of protection in a modern computer system.

• Explain how protection domains, combined with an access matrix, are used to specify the resources a process may access.

• Examine capability- and language-based protection systems.

• Describe how protection mechanisms can mitigate system attacks.
