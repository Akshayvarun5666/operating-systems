**_File System_**
 A _file_ is a collection of related information defined by its creator. Files are mapped by the operating system onto physical mass-storage devices. A file system describes how files are mapped onto physical devices, as well as how they are accessed andmanipulated by both users and programs.

Accessing physical storage can often be slow, so file systems must be designed for efficient access. Other requirements may be important as well, including providing support for file sharing and remote access to files.
