# Operating - System Structures

An operating system provides the environment within which programs are executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in theirmakeup, since they are organized alongmany different lines. The design of a newoperating system is a major task. It is important that the goals of the system be well defined before the design begins. These goals form the basis for choices among various algorithms and strategies.

We can view an operating system from several vantage points. One view focuses on the services that the system provides; another, on the interface that it makes available to users and programmers; a third, on its components and their interconnections. In this chapter, we explore all three aspects of operating systems, showing the viewpoints of users, programmers, and operating system designers. We consider what services an operating system provides, how they are provided, how they are debugged, and what the various methodologies are for designing such systems. Finally, we describe how operating systems are created and how a computer starts its operating system.

**CHAPTER OBJECTIVES**

• Identify services provided by an operating system.

• Illustrate how system calls are used to provide operating system services.

• Compare and contrast monolithic, layered, microkernel, modular, and hybrid strategies for designing operating systems.

• Illustrate the process for booting an operating system.

• Apply tools for monitoring operating system performance.

• Design and implement kernel modules for interacting with a Linux kernel.
