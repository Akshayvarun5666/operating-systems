# Networks and Distributed Systems

**Updated by Sarah Diesburg**

A distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share memory or a clock. Instead, each node has its own local memory. The nodes communi- cate with one another through various networks, such as high-speed buses. Distributed systems are more relevant than ever, and you have almost cer- tainly used some sort of distributed service. Applications of distributed sys- tems range from providing transparent access to files inside an organization, to large-scale cloud file and photo storage services, to business analysis of trends on large data sets, to parallel processing of scientific data, andmore. In fact, the most basic example of a distributed system is onewe are all likely very familiar with—the Internet.

In this chapter, we discuss the general structure of distributed systems and the networks that interconnect them. We also contrast the main differ- ences in the types and roles of current distributed system designs. Finally, we investigate some of the basic designs and design challenges of distributed file systems.

**CHAPTER OBJECTIVES**

• Explain the advantages of networked and distributed systems.

• Provide a high-level overview of the networks that interconnect distributed systems.

• Define the roles and types of distributed systems in use today.

• Discuss issues concerning the design of distributed file systems.
